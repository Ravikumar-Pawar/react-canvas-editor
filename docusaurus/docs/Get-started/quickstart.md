# Quick Start

Let's explore the Document Editor in less than 5 minutes.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Document Editor, you'll need to initialize it in your project and specify the container element where the editor will be embedded.

```javascript
import { DocumentEditor } from '@mindfiredigital/react-canvas-editor';
import React from 'react';

export const App = () => <DocumentEditor />;
```

:::info

Note that after importing '@mindfiredigital/react-canvas-editor,' your project may experience a longer initial load time, but subsequent loads should be quicker.

:::

Please make sure that you import the library correctly, and your editor will function smoothly.
